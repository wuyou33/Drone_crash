Add 18thApr model. However the no_solution / no_covergance problem happens. The former problem was never seen in the previous research while the latter one is possible to be resolved by introducing more items in the cost function.
The single rootr model is also added. However the same problem happens.
Since above problem only happens to the complex model, I doubt if it is due to the numerical differentiation.
